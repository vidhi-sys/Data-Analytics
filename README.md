## 📚 **Learning Modules**

### 1. **Introduction to Pandas: Data Cleaning and Manipulation**  
     
   - **Skills Covered:**  
     - Handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers.  
     - Column transformations, filtering, and aggregation.  
     - Merging/joining datasets with `pd.merge()`.  
   - **Key Takeaways:**  
     - Optimized a messy sales dataset (50K+ rows) by reducing null values by 90%.  
     - Automated cleaning workflows using Pandas pipelines.  

### 2. **Visualizing Data Trends with Matplotlib & Seaborn**  
    
   - **Skills Covered:**  
     - Customizing plots (histograms, scatter plots, box plots).  
     - Identifying correlations and distributions.  
     - Creating publication-quality visualizations.  
   - **Key Takeaways:**  
     - Visualized COVID-19 trends, highlighting regional mortality rate disparities.  
     - Built an interactive dashboard for exploratory data analysis (EDA).  

### 3. **End-to-End Data Analytics Project**  
    
   - **Skills Covered:**  
     - Web scraping/data collection (APIs/BeautifulSoup).  
     - SQL integration for querying structured data.  
     - PowerBI/Tableau for stakeholder reporting.  
   - **Key Takeaways:**  
     - Scraped job market data (10K+ listings) and derived salary vs. skill demand trends.  
     - Designed a PowerBI dashboard for real-time job market insights.
